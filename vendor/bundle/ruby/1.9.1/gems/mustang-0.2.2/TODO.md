* better exceptions handling
* V8::Integer should inherit V8::Number
* specs for Mustang context
* specs for support modules
* v8 debug stuff
* support for ObjectTemplates
* reflecting ruby classes to FunctionTemplates
* getting entered context

* V8::Data, V8::Value, V8::Primitive should be modules included in
  other v8's datatypes. All that types should inherit native ruby
  classes as well.
